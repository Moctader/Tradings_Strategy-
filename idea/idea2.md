Machine Learning Model Prediction:

A machine learning model (e.g., a regression model) is trained on historical stock data to predict the closing price of a stock for the next time period.
Why Classification?:

To make trading decisions (buy, sell, hold), we convert the predicted closing price into classification signals. For example:
If the predicted price is higher than the current price, generate a "buy" signal.
If it’s lower, generate a "sell" signal.
Classification simplifies decision-making by categorizing the model's predictions into actionable signals.
Executing Trades:

Based on the classification signals (buy/sell), a trading strategy is implemented. This strategy can include position sizing based on the model's confidence in its predictions.
Why Use ffn?:

The ffn library is employed to validate the effectiveness of the trading signals generated:
Backtesting: It simulates past trades to evaluate how well the strategy would have performed based on historical data.
Performance Metrics: ffn calculates key metrics (e.g., total returns, drawdowns) to assess the strategy’s effectiveness.
Visualization: It provides visual tools to track performance over time, helping to analyze the results of the trading strategy.
Validation and Refinement:

Insights from ffn enable the trader to validate the model's predictions and refine the trading strategy as needed, improving future predictions and decision-making.
Summary
In summary, a machine learning model predicts closing prices, which are classified into actionable buy/sell signals. These signals guide trading decisions, while ffn validates and analyzes the performance of the strategy, providing feedback for refinement and ensuring a data-driven approach to trading.
