The main idea of the implementation is to use a machine learning model to generate buy and sell signals for stock trading, while dynamically adjusting position sizes based on the model's confidence in each prediction. By leveraging confidence scores from the model, the strategy invests more aggressively in high-confidence trades and conservatively in lower-confidence trades. This approach integrates risk management by limiting the maximum position size and aims to optimize profitability by making informed, data-driven decisions.
