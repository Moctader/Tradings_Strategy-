The decision-making process in financial trading involves creating signals from regression and classification models to indicate when to buy, sell, or hold. A trading strategy is then developed based on these signals, where actions are executed immediately upon receiving a buy signal and positions are held until a sell signal is generated. Profitability can be enhanced by doubling down on positions when receiving repeated buy signals. To ensure consistency and streamline signal generation, an abstract class for signals can be utilized. This process also involves monitoring positions over time to evaluate entry and exit points, facilitating effective trading actions based on machine learning predictions.
